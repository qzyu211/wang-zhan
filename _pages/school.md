学校 (Xuéxiào) is translated as school. If we want to learn properly, it would help to do so in a structured manner.

Although it’s possible to read through pages of material, it is not necessarily the case that the material is well understood. The simplest method towards developing a more comprehensive understanding of a new concept is to practice it repeatedly until the topic is well known. Reading through various topics on this website makes it abundantly clear that there is a compounding problem that comes with so much new information. A solution towards learning the material in a step-by-step manner but also towards having a practical comprehension of the knowledge gained is through diligent practice.

“Practice is the sole criterion for testing truth.” – Hu Fuming, Guangming Daily, 11 May 1978

We shouldn’t let ourselves fall for the trap of blindly following these algorithms without questioning their results. It is integral that we can interpret the principles of their inner workings such that we will be able to apply them correctly and successfully derive our own conclusions.
I am working on a learning platform where interested students may carefully learn the material in a step-by-step manner. With this structured process, students can gain an understanding of the lessons on this website in an entirety.
