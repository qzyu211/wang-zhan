# Introduction
大家好。Hey everybody, my name is Jared Yu. In this post, I will explain to others what the motivation is behind this GitHub page. The purpose of this website is to help others better understand various topics related to statistics, data science, and machine learning. Some may wonder, “Why would I spend so much time writing about these topics?” The answer is that these topics are not necessarily thoroughly understood the first time around and by explaining them to others in clear and simple terms, they can be better learned by myself. This is also known as learning by teaching, a way for students to teach fellow students material that they have learned previously themselves.

"It is the supreme art of the teacher to awaken joy in creative expression and knowledge." - Albert Einstein

Another view is that I understand that I am incredibly lucky to have studied statistics and data science from the professors at the universities that I have been part of. At the same time, I know that there is a large community of data science and machine learning enthusiasts who are eager to learn but unable to find the proper resources to attain their goals. In that sense, I would like to work towards helping bridge this gap in knowledge and experience by making this a free platform that extends to all corners of cyberspace.

"Education equality is the basis of social equality." - President Xi Jinping
