## The Benefit of Matrix Representation
The usefulness of matrix representation will be expressed briefly. Within introductory statistical courses, the univariate (data with one variable, e.g., height) is explored and different types of statistical inference are briefly covered. However, in order to extend these analysis to data with multivariate (data with more than one variable, e.g., height and weight) properties, it's possible to retain the same tools of analysis, with the exception that data and calculations are done using matrices.
