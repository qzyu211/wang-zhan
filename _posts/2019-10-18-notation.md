In this post, the common matrix notation used on this website will be thoroughly explained. The importance for learning how to understand the matrix representation is so that it's possible to follow along step-by-step the meaning of the various formulas.

## The Benefit of Matrix Representation
The usefulness of matrix representation will be expressed briefly. Within introductory statistical courses, the univariate (data with one variable, e.g., height) is explored and different types of statistical inference are briefly covered. However, in order to extend these analysis to data with multivariate (data with more than one variable, e.g., height and weight) properties, it's possible to retain the same tools of analysis, with the exception that data and calculations are done using matrices.

## The Style of Notation Used on this Website
For the remainder of the page, it will be assumed that basic linear algebra has already been learned (if you have not learned or need to review, please visit [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra)).

In multivariate statistics, the way that matrix notation is used is that vectors are expressed as follows. Consider the data $$n \times p$$ matrix, $$\textbf{X}$$, it can be visualized below.

$$\begin{bmatrix}
x_{1,1} & x_{1,2} & \cdots & x_{1,p} \\
x_{2,1} & x_{2,2} & \cdots & x_{2,p} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
x_{n,1} & x_{n,2} & \cdots & x_{n,p}
\end{bmatrix}$$
